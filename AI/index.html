            <h1>Why am I interested in AI:</h1>
            
            <p1>Good question Adam! 
                <br><br>• Primarily, I think I am fascinated by the concept of AGI, that we could possibly create our own synthetic form of life. 
                <br>Like Lex Fridman, I believe the "best way to understand the mind is to build it" and "AI began with an ancient wish to forge the gods" - Pamela McCorduck. 
                How they work is beyond obvious understanding, and to me that makes them mystical, exiting and constantly mind-blowing :D
                <br><br>• Since I've been aware of the existance of AI, I've always been fascinated as to how it works, learns, because in my mind before I understood the mathematics
                behind AI, I thought all machines had to be pre-programmed, told what to do in every recognised circumstance.
                <br><br>• I believe AI will be the most significant development in my lifetime, the applications of AI are endless, and the capability of AI now, and even more so in the future,
                is revolutionary. The mere idea of a machine more capable than man is a fascinating idea philosophically, scientifically, and economically, and one would suppose its creation would
                revolutionise the way society functions.
