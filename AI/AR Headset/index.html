                <br>It's a shame I only trained the hand detection in the light...

            <h1>About: AR Headset</h1>
            
            <p1>Why I made this one is simple: 
                <br>I wanted an AR headset because I think they're really cool, but they were all too expensive, so I decided to make my own!
                <br><br>I coded the camera in January 2021, but held off on the project until after my GCSEs, when I then coded the UI and hand detection AI in July and early August.
                <br>Obviously, mine is at least half as good and twice as big as those on the market, so roughly 8x as inconvenient, but its still really cool :D 
                <br><br>This project was my first proper project using the raspberryPI, my first actually useful implementation of a neural net I made in pyTorch and my first
                experience of actual frustration while coding... but it was worth it!
                <br>My frustration came from my camera cable being too short; there being no documentation I could find on the internet about how to make the mmalobj outputs render only semi-opaque; limited
                mmalobj documentation in general; only old versions of pytorch working for me on the rPI4; not being able to easily transfer neural networks to older versions
                of pytorch; my pi crashing every time I ran a version of my Headset with a higher resolution; and most importantly of all: having to write code onto my rPI from a tiny, awkward
                keyboard!!! (v n v)
                <br>Oh, and also the fact that my rPI4 completely broke just as I was about to finish - my files were luckily on a USB drive, but I had to reinstall
                raspbian, python all the python libraries required.
                <br><br>So, if you wanted to make something like this yourself, you've come to the right place! Let me be your beacon of hope ( ＾ᴗ＾ ) /

            <h1>Download: AR Headset</h1>

            <p1><b>Hardware:</b>
                <br>Here are the products I purchased to make the AR headset:
                <br>• <a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a>
                <br>• <a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-case?variant=31140399874110">Raspberry Pi 4 Dark Case</a>
                <br>• <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TechRise-Adjustable-Comfortable-Compatible-Smartphones/dp/B078946LZM/">5 inch 3D VR Headset</a>
                <br>• <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/MakerHawk-Wide-angle-Automatically-Day-Vision-Night-Vision/dp/B07DRH5Y5S/">PI 4 Wide Angle Infra Red Camera</a>
                <br>• <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Screen-Capacitive-Touch-Monitor/dp/B07YCBWRQP/">5 inch HDMI Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor</a>
                <br><br>Note: I cut a hole in the Pi case so the camera cable could run into the case; I cut a hole in the front of the headset to make room for the camera (which I screwed into position);
                I cut holes in the top so I could plug the power and HDMI cables into the screen, and holes in the top to allow the screen to fit. I also attached the Pi to the headset using velcro.
                <br>Be careful when doing all of this! You don't want to break anything!
                <br><br><b>Software:</b>
                <br>This is the wheel I used to download pyTorch:
                <a href="https://github.com/shashigharti/federated-learning-on-raspberry-pi/blob/master/PyTorch%20Wheels/torch-1.0.0a0%2B8322165-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl">torch-1.0.0a0+8322165-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl</a>
                <br>In order to screenshot the output from the camera (the best (in my experience) way to capture photos from the camera while it is streaming),
                I needed to install <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFromMelbourne/raspi2png">raspi2png</a>.
                <br><br><b>Click the image of the main python file below to download all the files I used to create this project, although I have included the pretrained model I
                created for this project (handNet.txt), I have also included the files I created to create said pretrained model, in case you wanted to make your own :)</b>
