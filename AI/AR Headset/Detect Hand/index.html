            <h1>Hand Trainer</h1>
            
            <p1>This was the first time I had used Google Colab to create code. 
                <br>I used it because it provided GPUs which would make training the AI much quicker than on my laptop.
                <br><br>This was also the first time I had used pyTorch, so my code is mostly copied from tutorials like <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html">this one</a>,
                and modified to suit my needs.
                <br>For instance, I needed to create a custom dataloader for the dataset I had created; I needed to save the model in TXT format so pyTorch on my rPI4 could open it; I needed to 
                modify the network architecture to work with my custom dataset; and I wanted
                to modify print messages and this line of code:
                <br><code>img = (img + 1) / 2 # unnormalize the funky way</code>... for some reason. ( ＾v＾)
                <br><br>After training, I tested my model on the test data, and it, much to my delight, correctly classified 115 images of 124: it was <b>92.74% accurate</b>.
                <br><img src="Tests.png" style="max-width: 50%; border: 5px solid rgb(15, 15, 15);"></img>
                <br><br>However, the test data was taken in similar lighting conditions to the training data, so in practice it is accurate enough, but not this accurate... I should proabably quantify this,
                but it would take too long for what it's worth.

            <h1>Hand Detection</h1>
            
            <p1>Now the AI was trained, I needed to make it run along with the UI and camera for my AR headset.
                <br>To do this, I coded a "DetectHand" class which handled loading of the network; the splitting of the 200x150 image into 48 25x25 images; 
                and the subsequent transforming and feeding of the images into the network for classification.
