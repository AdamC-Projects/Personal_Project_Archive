            <h1>About my von Neumann Computer:</h1>
            <p1>I think it is probably closer to a <a href="https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/">little man computer</a> (that's what I based this project off) but that isn't an architecture...
                <br>Aside from the D flip flop I copied for storing nibbles, I created all the logic circuits for how the ALU, CU and everything else works, and because of 
                <a href="https://www.kolls.net/gatesim/">the software I was using to create it</a>, my circuits were quite messy and slow to run... I think the scale of my project was a bit too large!
                <br><br>Because I made the computer ages ago, I can't remeber exactly what everything does, so I'll be lazy and just explain what everything does on a high level, feel free to 
                decompose the circuits though, I'll link them below :)

            <h1>The computer</h1>
            <p1>Consists of the cache, an input box, output box and the cpu.
                <br>The reset button should be toggled on then off to begin with. Then, iterate through the lines of machine code stored in the cache by slowly toggling the clock button on then off.
                <br>If the user input light turns on, input a number into the input box, and press the confirm button to send the value you entered to the accumulator.
                <br>When you download the file below, it will have a program in it that doubles an inputted number, each line of code is below:
                <br>
                <br>1100 0000 - Get an input from the user and set the accumulator to that value, 
                <br>0000 0001 - Store accumulator value in variable 1, 
                <br>0001 0001 - Load the value from variable 1 into the accumulator (just to show that it can), 
                <br>1000 0001 - Add value from variable 1 to the accumulator and set the accumulator to that value
                <br>0000 0010 - Store accumulator value in variable 2 (for fun I guess, I wrote this code a when I made this... blame a past version of me, not present me!), 
                <br>1101 0000 - Output accumulator value
                <br>1110 0000 - Stops the fetch decode execute cycle - end of code
                <br><br><b>You can view all the instructions for writing your own code <a href="Instructions.txt">here</a>.</b>
                <br><br><b>Click the circuit below to download the gatesim file (you can double click on a custom gate to see what it is composed of, so this is the only file I'll link):</b>
