            <h1>Enigma Machine</h1>
            
            <p1>Completing this project in 2019, I think, gave me the most respect for myself up until that moment; from that point forward
                I was no longer just interested about coding - I was passionate about it: I had found my calling :D
                <br><br>In school we were tasked to make a Ceasar cipher, which I enjoyed creating, but felt I only had a taste of challenge.
                My computer science teacher suggested I created a Vigenere cipher, which was certainly more rewarding to create, but I was aware of the 
                Enigma machine, and took it upon myself to recreate it in python.
                <br><br>Most of the challenge, I recall, came from the requirement to understand exactly how the machine worked, as intentionally, there
                are a lot of moving, swappable and confusing aspects to the design of the Enigma machine.
                <br>The project also helped me gain deeper understanding about how programming languages work, what mindset one has to be in when coding, 
                and how easy it is to code now, compared to in the 1940s when the Enigma machine was being utilised. It gave me confidence in my ability, 
                and perhaps even motivation to try harder in all aspects of school! Maybe I'm romanticising, but I really beleive this project was a turing point
                for me, if you'll pardon the pun :)
                <br><br>Select your settings, and then you can encode a message, reselect your settings, and then you can decode that message.
                <br>Maybe in the future I'll work on a brute force decoder... :)
