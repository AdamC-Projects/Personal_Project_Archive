<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p1>Hey, welcome to my website!<br>Here I intent to be posting any projects that I feel like sharing.<br><br>Some projects I have uploaded I will have done years ago but decided to make write-ups 
    for and included on this website.<br>If you are friend of mine you will know these will most likely all be coding projects, with a twist here and there, and if you're not then you know now :D
</p1>

<h1>How to use this awesome website:</h1>
<p1>Most of it should be fairly straight forward, you can either scroll through the content in the middle of your screen yourself, or there is a "contents" bar to the right you can use instead.
    <br>Note: the contents bar may be small, especially for mobile users, but honestly I don't want it taking up anymore of the screen, it's not that important c:
    <br><br>You can browse my projects using the menu to the left and return back to here by clicking the logo.

<h1>Issues:</h1>
<p1>I know the background gif can take a while to load... might I suggest patience?
    <br>Although I will be checking to be certain there are no bugs with the website - I am certain there will be ._. Feel free to send any you come across to my 
    <a href="mailto:xandprojects@gmail.com">email</a>. Also any feedback regarding the website in general would be much appreciated :D 
    <br>Just don't correct my bad speling... :(

<h1>About the creator:</h1>
<p1>Wow, you are actually interested??? Well, if you don't know me already, my name is Adam (aka xand because I am <i>very</i> good at coming up with nicknames...)
    <br>Anyway, I am a Briton studying maths, physics and computer science (if you couldn't already tell). I don't really understand why but I have a passion for these subjects which I've found is 
    helpful when it comes to studying them, so for that I am grateful :)
    <br><br>Primarily, I am fascinated by AI, automation, and physics of the very big (cosmology) and very small (quantum). Well, at least at the moment... 
    <br><br>I also enjoy: listening to music (lo-fi, synthwave, jazz and everything between), analysing music, playing piano, and composing (I regret not doing it for GCSE...); 
    I enjoy philosophy (a new interest for me); and most things nintendo c:
