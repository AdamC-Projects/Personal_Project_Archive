            <p1>Well, relative to me, the physics related projects are listed on the left of the screen, however, relative to my reflection, they're on the right.

            <h1>Why I am passionate about physics:</h1>
            
            <p1>Good question Adam! 
                <br><br>• My passion for physics is of the same nature as my interest in philosophy - I love asking deep, fundamental questions; and reasoning to find potential answers.
                <br><br>• Additionally, like computer science, I enjoy the problem solving and mathematical aspect of the subject.
                <br><br>• My primary reason for loving physics is because the subject of physics is concerned with the fundamental questions
                about reality: Why are things as they are? Why are we here? Although we haven't found any fundamental answers, and probably will never,
                addressing these deep, philosophical questions feels vital to the progression of humanity, vital to our appreciation for existance, 
                vital to our outlook on life.
                <br><br>• The revolutionary history of physics, the beautiful equations that govern our reality and the vital questions still left unanswered
                make physics, to me, seem like the most romantic, important and fundamentally human field of science - (the field of machine learning is perhaps the only field
                that contests with fundamental physics in terms of deep, philosphoical and human importance). 
                <br>As Richard Feynman said: "Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it."
