# Welcome!

Hey, welcome to my repository!
The messages below are also on the homepage of my website [here](https://xandprojects.github.io/), but here you can view the code I've written in all its fullness :D

Some projects I have uploaded I will have done years ago but decided to make write-ups for and included on this website.
If you are friend of mine you will know these will most likely all be coding projects, with a twist here and there, and if you're not then you know now :D

# How to use this awesome website:

Most of it should be fairly straight forward, you can either scroll through the content in the middle of your screen yourself, or there is a "contents" bar to the right you can use instead.
Note: the contents bar may be small, especially for mobile users, but honestly I don't want it taking up anymore of the screen, it's not that important c:
You can browse my projects using the menu to the left and return back to here by clicking the logo.

# Issues:

I know the background gif can take a while to load... might I suggest patience?
Although I will be checking to be certain there are no bugs with the website - I am certain there will be ._. Feel free to send any you come across to my email. 
Also any feedback regarding the website in general would be much appreciated :D 
Just don't correct my bad speling... :(

# About the creator:

Wow, you are actually interested??? 
Well, if you don't know me already, my name is Adam (aka xand because I am *very* good at coming up with nicknames...).
Anyway, I am a Briton studying maths, physics and computer science (if you couldn't already tell). 
I don't really understand why but I have a passion for these subjects which I've found is helpful when it comes to studying them, so for that I am grateful :)

Primarily, I am fascinated by AI, automation, and physics of the very big (cosmology) and very small (quantum). Well, at least at the moment... 
I also enjoy: listening to music (lo-fi, synthwave, jazz and everything between), analysing music, playing piano, and composing (I regret not doing it for GCSE...); 
I enjoy philosophy (a new interest for me); and most things nintendo c:
