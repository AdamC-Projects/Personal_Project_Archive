            <p1><br>I initally wrote this code to detect what notes I was playing on piano in real time; while it was alright at that, I abandoned it once I realised
                I could read the MIDI data in real time directly from the keyboard (I use keyboard and piano interchangeably) in python. 
                I probably should have realised this sooner, as I almost want to call this code here
                waste of time, but it still works well (although not when two notes are playing simultaneously), 
                and I copied the scale detection algorithm (although it still could be improved) into my new project code :)
                <br>Said new project will hopefully accompany me playing piano... I started it a while ago, and it's another project I need to return to, when I figure out
                whether I want to use an AI for it or not...

            <h1>How I recorded the video above:</h1>

            <p1>In retrospect, this is probably not worth mentioning, but for whatever reason, Xbox game bar won't let you record multiple windows at once.
                <br>So, I wrote a quick script to take a screenshot and display it in one window, for the game bar to record. Actually, I could've just saved the
                screenshots directly into a video, or downloaded better screen capture software, but finding this loophole was fun :D
