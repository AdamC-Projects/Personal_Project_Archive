            <h1>Visualisers</h1>
            
            <p1>Music visualisers has always fascinated me, it's like the visuals are dancing around the screen, enjoying the music as much as I, 
                and I can sit and watch it for hours ( ＾v＾) (...maybe)
                <br><br>Making my own music visualisers has taught me a lot about how one goes about decomposing a sound track, the structure of WAV files,
                and how mathematical the nature of audio analysis is. 
                <br>They're also the most satisfying and cool projects when they work :D
                <br><br>All of my visualisers work in real time, because all the music I listen to is on youtube, so to capture the audio I use an app called

            <h1>GIF to the Beat</h1>
            <iframe style="width: 50%; height: 28%; border: 5px solid rgb(15, 15, 15);" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4xKWYnlSFk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
            <p1><br>This is the coolest code I've written!
                <br>The code gets audio data from the stream in real time; gets the bass from the data; subtracts it from the previous sample of data (to get the gradient of the sound wave);
                and iterates a given GIF by a number of frames proportiaonal to said gradient!
                <br>The idea being, wherever there is a steep gradient in time x bass amplitude graph, there has been a drum beat. In effect, this means the gif moves to the beat!
                <br>Due to the simplicity of the beat detection algorithm, this code works brilliantly on synthwave music, lofi, and any other songs with a distinct beat, but still decently
                for other songs. It also works best with seamless GIFs.
                <br>It threw me out of my seat how well this worked once I had written it!
