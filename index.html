            <h1>Welcome!</h1>

            <p1>Hey, welcome to my website! ( ＾ᴗ＾ ) /
                <br>Here I intent to be posting any projects that I feel like sharing.
                <br><br>Some projects I have uploaded will have been done years ago but that I decided to make write-ups 
                for and include on this website now.
                <br>If you are friend of mine you will know these will most likely all be coding projects, with a twist here and there, and if you're not then you know now :D

            <h1>How to use this <i>awesome</i> website:</h1>
            <p1>Most of it should be fairly straight forward, you can either scroll through the content in the middle of your screen yourself, or there is a "contents" bar to the right you can use instead.
                <br>You can access this by clicking the arrow in the top-right of the page.
                <br>Note: the contents bar may be small, especially for mobile users, but honestly I don't want it taking up anymore of the screen - it's not that important ( ＾v＾)
                <br><br>You can browse my projects using the menu to the left and return back to here by clicking the logo.

            <h1>Issues:</h1>
            <p1>Please use Chrome on a pc/laptop for the best experience, as this is what I have predominantly tested when making this site.
                <br><br>Although I will be checking to be certain there are no bugs with the website - I am certain there will be (v _ v) Feel free to send any you come across to my 
                <a href="mailto:xandprojects@gmail.com">email</a>. Also any feedback regarding the website in general would be much appreciated :D 
                <br>Just don't correct my bad speling... :(

            <h1>About the creator:</h1>
            <p1>Wow, you are actually interested??? Well, if you don't know me already, my name is Adam Catley (aka xand because I am <i>very</i> good at coming up with nicknames...)
                <br>Anyway, I am a Briton studying maths, physics and computer science (if you couldn't already tell). I don't really understand why but I have a passion for these subjects which I've found is 
                helpful when it comes to studying them, so for that I am grateful :)
                <br><br>Primarily, I am fascinated by AI, automation, physics of the very big (cosmology) and very small (quantum); and understanding our place in the cosmos. Well, at least at the moment... 
                <br><br>I also enjoy: listening to music (lo-fi, synthwave, jazz and everything between) and playing piano (I'd like to start composing music but I'm in the valley of despair at the moment...); 
                I enjoy philosophy (a new interest for me); and most things nintendo ( ＾v＾)
