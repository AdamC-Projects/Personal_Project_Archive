            <h1>Why I am learning Unity:</h1>
            
            <p1>Good question Adam! 
                <br><br>• Primarily, I wanted to become familiar with Unity as it would allow me to easily model and program 3d objects if I ever needed to.
                For example, if I wanted to simulate the atom or a robotic arm, I could do that in Unity with relative ease. In this sense I suppose I viewed Unity
                as a handy tool to have at my disposal. 
                <br><br>• It also uses C# as it's scripting language, which is what my sixth form will be teaching me, so I wanted to become familiar with the language before
                I started there... get ahead of the game, I guess.
                <br><br>• I wanted to learn Unity as a challenge to myself; I've never really done anything like this before!
                <br><br>• Finally, I was inspired by the game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginner%27s_Guide">The Beginner's Guide</a>, which features a fictional programmer
                named Coda who makes simple games with deeper meaning. I was enticed by the idea of using games as a platform for expressing world, life or philosophical views, and wanted to do such myself.
                In retrospect, I think this is also why I like the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask">Majora's Mask</a> so much.
