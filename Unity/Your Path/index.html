            <h1>About: Your Path</h1>

            <p1> Your Path is the first (and as of writing only) game I have made in Unity. 
                <br>Therefore, making this project has been a great learning experience for me: developing my familiarity with Unity,
                C# (the programming language it uses for scripting), procedural generation, and game making in general. Needless to say, I really enjoyed said experience,
                and will certainly be making similar games in the future!
                <br><br>This game was inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14">Kurzgesagt's video on Optimistic Nihilism</a>,
                a philosophy that has inspired and shaped me, and which I try my best to live by. 
                <br>In the game I wanted to make, however, I wanted to be more specific, and focus on the idea that we should aim to create our own goals, direction, 
                and future that we wish to pursue (an idea I am determined to stick by as I advance through education); for only then can we find meaning in our own lives.
                <br>And so I came up with gameplay teaching the player to create their own path and explore the forest around them - in their own direction at their own pace - 
                and not to blindly follow the path laid out for them.
                <br><br>In the end I am pleased with the game I created; sure, it may be unoptimised, and the models are most certainly not stylish or realistic, but that's not what I set out
                to achieve.

            <h1>Play: Your Path</h1>

            <p1> Below is an online version of 'Your Path', I find the controls a bit sensitive and this is a common issue for webGL Unity games, so I recommend running the executable version linked
                <a href="./Your Path executable.zip">here</a>.
                <br>I have also linked the Unity project files for Your Path (which you can move into a Unity project for yourself) 
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNl-gsiDl1cz7qWTPs5Fz2-iFXlHb6h2/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. 
                If this does not work for whatever reason, please inform me via my <a href="mailto:xandprojects@gmail.com">email</a>.
                <br><br><b>Click the image to start, you can make the game full-screen by pressing the full-screen button, and ensure you have clicked on the game once it has started to lock your mouse in position :)</b>
                <br>Enjoy!
