            <h1>Terrain Generation</h1>
            
            <p1>To procedurally generate the hilly terrain, I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3">code written by Sebastian Lague</a>.
                <br>I copied relevant code from episodes 1-5, so I recommend watching them to understand how the algorithm works :)
                
                <br><br>I copied the code into the files <a href="./GenerateMesh.cs">GenerateMesh.cs</a> and <a href="./Noise.cs">Noise.cs</a> and added a collision mesh creator for obvious reasons.

            <h1>Generate World</h1>

            <p1>Inspired by Sebastian's procedural landmass generation, I created a procedural forest generator - in retrospect that would've been a much more apt name for the script... (v _ v)
                <br><br>The amount of <code>if</code> statements I used writing it hurt my optimisation hunting eyes, but I think they were at least neccessary to make the code understandable.
                In short, the code generates the trees, sticks, stones and log seats at spaced yet pseudo-random positions throughout the forest. Trees are the most probable to be generated, logs
                the least. The trees are at pseudo-random heights, with a pseudo-random number of branches (2-4). 
                <br><br>They are pseudo-randomly generated so that the same forest is generated for a given seed; however, ultimately I decided to generate a random seed for each different game, because
                each player's life is different, so their forest is different and thus their route through it; yet the trodden path remains the same for everyone. It also makes the forest harder
                to navigate.
                <br><br>Surprisingly, the most technical part of this entire project was getting the generated sticks, stones and seats to align themselves with the terrain beneath them. I settle on a solution
                which allowed me to calculate the graident between the collision points on the terrain from two raycasts, which the object would then be aligned to: lines 21-42 below.
