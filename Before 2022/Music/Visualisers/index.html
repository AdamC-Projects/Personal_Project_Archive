            <h1>Visualisers</h1>
            
            <p1>Music visualisers has always fascinated me, it's like the visuals are dancing around the screen, enjoying the music as much as I, 
                and I can sit and watch it for hours ( ＾v＾) (...maybe)
                <br><br>Making my own music visualisers has taught me a lot about how one goes about decomposing a sound track, the structure of WAV files,
                and how mathematical the nature of audio analysis is. 
                <br>They're also the most satisfying and cool projects when they work :D
                <br><br>All of my visualisers work in real time, because all the music I listen to is on youtube, so to capture the audio I use an app called

            <p1><br>This is the coolest code I've written!
                <br>The code gets audio data from the stream in real time; gets the bass from the data; subtracts it from the previous sample of data (to get the gradient of the sound wave);
                and iterates a given GIF by a number of frames proportiaonal to said gradient!
                <br>The idea being, wherever there is a steep gradient in time x bass amplitude graph, there has been a drum beat. In effect, this means the gif moves to the beat!
                <br>Due to the simplicity of the beat detection algorithm, this code works brilliantly on synthwave music, lofi, and any other songs with a distinct beat, but still decently
                for other songs. It also works best with seamless GIFs.
                <br>It threw me out of my seat how well this worked once I had written it!
                <br><br>I think the bottom video dosen't have a frame rate fast enough for it to look the best on youtube, when I was watching it, 
                it definitely didn't look like it was jittering forward and back... oh well...

            <p1><br>This project was the natural extension of the one above: of course I want a GIF to the Beat as my wallpaper!
                <br><br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/">Wallpaper Engine</a> has a brilliant editing tool that allows you to create your own wallpapers
                using HTML and Javasctipt. Initially, I manually split my favourite GIF's (the cyberpunk coffee one) frames into PNGs and created a website that looped through each PNG in order. 
                This worked well, and since I already knew how I would go about visualising the audio, it was relativley easy to code.
                <br>However, like with the python version above, I wanted to be able to animate <i>any</i>> GIF to the beat. This proved more difficult, as the only library I could find to do this was 
                <a href="https://github.com/buzzfeed/libgif-js">libgif</a>. 
                <br>I had to modify some of the code in it's JS file so that the image would:
                <br>• Fill the screen
                <br>• Align with the centre of the screen
                <br>• Have toggleable image smoothing
                <br><br>It was a fun weekend project, and I have uploaded the final product to the <b>Steam Workshop</b> - which you can access 
                <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2636106215">here</a>.

            <p1><br>Waveplot was an excuse to experiment with how audio could be visualised :)
                <br>On the left are the sound waves from the sample just collected, split into what could be considered bass, medium and treble.
                <br>In the middle is the classic visualisation: a stream of sound waves from a few seconds of samples collected, split into bass and treble.
                <br>On the right is a frequency x intensity graph of the audio from the sample just collected. I did not normalise it for this python file because I prefered
                the look of it without normalisation (I think...)
                <br><br>I hope what I said above is technically accurate, if not, please correct me :)
