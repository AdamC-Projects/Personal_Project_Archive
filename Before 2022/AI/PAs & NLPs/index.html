            <h1>About: PAs & NLPs</h1>
            
            <p1> I think I made my first personal assistant after watching Iron Man and seeing JARVIS. In fact, JARVIS might be part of the reason 
                I am passionate about AI, how cool would it be to have an assistant like JARVIS? 
                <br>I decided the name Trillian was suitable for a personal assistant, and intend to use it for each version I make.
                <br>Versions 1 and 2 are pretty basic, and more so just me experimenting with libraries in python, but I spent quite a while making them and wouldn't want to forget
                about them, so I'll include on this website :D I shouldn't need to justify why I did something to myself or to you, but I just did, oh well...

            <h1>PA & NLP: Version 1</h1>
            
            <p1>My version 1 personal assistant was a concatenation of a lot of unique, novel, in principle helpful but not in practice, features; as well as a primitive NLP.
                The project was still cool to me at the time, and helped me learn how to import and use python libraries, this was the first time I had done this.

                <br><br>I would like to return to the world of NLPs in the future, perhaps I'll make or utilise a better one for my next PA - Version 3

                <br><br>There is over 19kB of code, and I'm not going to screenshot it all, instead you can download it <a href="Version 1.zip">here</a>, if that's alright :)
                <br>Also, I'm very doubtful all of it still works... (v _ v)
                <br>Also, I copied most of this description from Version 2. The projects were pretty similar in nature and shared a few features :)

            <h1>PA (a Discord bot): Version 2</h1>
            
            <p1>My version 2 personal assistant was another concatenation of a lot of unique, novel, in principle helpful but not in practice, features.
                The project was still cool to me at the time, and helped me learn how to use multiprocessing and the discord API - this was the first time I used these.

                <br><br>There is over 17kB of code, and I'm not going to screenshot it all, instead you can download it <a href="Version 2.zip">here</a>, if that's alright :)
                <br>Also, I'm very doubtful it still works...
