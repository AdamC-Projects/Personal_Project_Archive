            <p1><br><br>I think this code might be the definition of optimising the fun out of a game...
                <br><br>(Initially, this was in the miscellaneous section, but I think because the only thing the program is essentially doing is calculating production line rates and requirements,
                it qualifies as a mathematical project)
                <br><br>Satisfactory is a game about creating production lines that will produce resources for you, which you can use
                to upgrade your production line to produce materials faster.
                <br>However, oftentimes, I don't want to commit to any specific production line, because I know there may be a more efficient
                one I haven't thought of that I should use.
                <br><br>This code was my attempt at a solution to this problem. You enter the product you want to make, and the rate you want to make it at 
                as well as any limits on the number of resources you are willing to extract from the earth per minute to create said product.
                <br>Because Satisfactory is a well designed game, there are countless recipes for any specific product. So, my program randomly finds
                up to 5 different recipes at a time (it can be run again if they are not <i>satisfactory</i> recipes).
                <br><br>The program then gives the user clear instructions on exactly how they should construct their factory, based off of their chosen recipe.
                <br>I was more than <i>satisfied</i> with the code I wrote, I found it very helpful for the planning phase of my factory construction,
                although as with all code I write for automation, I probably would have saved time by instead thinking for myself... (v _ v)
                <br>In retrospect, the program was a kind of meta automation: automating the process of building a factory which purpose is to automate the production line; neat ( ＾v＾)
                <br><br>Here is <a href="Recipe for Modular Frame.txt">an example recipe</a>.
