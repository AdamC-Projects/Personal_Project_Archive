Issue: logic cannot differentiate between walking down a slope and falling, should probably check with other mechanisms too.
if (transform.position.y - prevHeight < -0.0001) //if going down (using a small negative number to ignore when sometimes player falls slightly through floor)
{ 
    down = true;
    jumpAllowed = false;
}
else if (down) //if was previously going down and is no longer (ie collided with ground)
{
    down = false;
    jumpAllowed = true;
}
