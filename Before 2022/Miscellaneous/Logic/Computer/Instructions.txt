Write first the OPCODE
(to indicate that's the command you'd like to execute), 
then include a 4 bit binary number as the OPERAND after if neccessary.
Each command should be entered starting from the top right of the cache.

sta	 00 00  Stores accumulator value into variable: OPERAND
lda	 00 01  Loads variable: OPERAND's value into accumulator 

add	 10 00  Adds value of variable: OPERAND to value in accumulator
sub	 10 01  Subtracts value in accumulator by value of variable: OPERAND

brz	 01 00  If the accumulator value is 0, jump to code line: OPERAND
brp	 01 01  If the accumulator value is greater than 0, jump to code line: OPERAND
bra	 01 10  Jump to code line: OPERAND

inp	 11 00  Loads USER INPUT value into accumulator
